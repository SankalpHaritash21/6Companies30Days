Why Sequelize is Still a Great Choice!
I see people switching to Prisma but let’s not forget:

✅ Full control over SQL
✅ Works with legacy databases
✅ Transaction handling is robust
✅ More customizable query building

Sequelize is like a powerful Swiss Army knife 🛠️. It’s flexible, works everywhere, and has been battle-tested for years!

Are you a Sequelize fan? Or have you jumped ship to Prisma? 😆
