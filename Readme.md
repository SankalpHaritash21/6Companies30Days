Relationships in Sequelize – Parent-Child Connections!
What if we have Users and their Posts? Sequelize makes relationships super simple!

Define models:

js
Copy code
const Post = sequelize.define("Post", {
title: DataTypes.STRING,
});

User.hasMany(Post);
Post.belongsTo(User);
Adding data:

js
Copy code
await User.create({
name: "Sankalp",
email: "sankalp@example.com",
Posts: [{ title: "My First Post" }]
}, { include: [Post] });
Now I can fetch user posts with one query! 😍

SQL Joins? Nah, Sequelize does it for me. 😎

Why Sequelize is Still a Great Choice!
I see people switching to Prisma but let’s not forget:

✅ Full control over SQL
✅ Works with legacy databases
✅ Transaction handling is robust
✅ More customizable query building

Sequelize is like a powerful Swiss Army knife 🛠️. It’s flexible, works everywhere, and has been battle-tested for years!

Are you a Sequelize fan? Or have you jumped ship to Prisma? 😆
